						Thrown into the GAME: Will you ACCEPT your fate? Or will you CONFRONT your fate?<br><br>Pulled by a strange magnetic force, NMIXX somehow broke through the walls of the world and discovered the existence of a whole new world. The girls set foot into a mystical world where everything they IMAGINE becomes REALITY. But soon, a giant whirlwind appears in front of them as the girls face the first real obstacle of their wild journey.<br><br>Every human being lives their life in fear. The fear and anxiety that the girls themselves created were too powerful. The gigantic shadows and swirling waves of chaotic thoughts, derived from the deepest depths of their subconsciousness, began to threaten NMIXX.<br><br>In a game-like journey, the girls who got the chance to expand their own world, ‘MIXX’, eventually realize a fact that would change their lives forever. The fact that the DICE has already been thrown, and the power to make their fate lies within their own hands.<br><br>Through the life-changing experiences they have went through during their journey towards ‘MIXXTOPIA’ with expanding their ‘MIXX’, the girls finally learn how to fully accept and realize their own emotions (COOL (Your Rainbow)) and understand the importance of having faith in their own choices. Now, the fate of NMIXX is in the hands of the girls.<br><br>Now, the most important question of all. Does that huge shadow that threatens you come from the ‘outside’? Or, does it come from ‘within you’?<br><br>In the New Frontier series, NMIXX willingly throw their selves into the adventures, even knowing that the journey will be full of trials and tribulations. And throughout their journey, they were able to create their own set of rules. The girls will now continue to find the meaning of existence and make countless decisions under their own names. Then, the girls will reach out their hands toward you so that you can face your own fears and break through them, leading you to a ‘WONDERFUL NEW WORLD’ that lies over the rainbow.

						<span style="font-weight: bold;">Both ‘DICE’ and ‘COOL (Your Rainbow)’ were produced by ARMADILLO, a promising up-and-comer in the K-Pop scene who has worked with TWICE, Stray Kids, DAVICHI, and 2am.</span><br><br>1. DICE *Title<br><br>‘DICE’ is a title track that compares the adventures of NMIXX trying to move forward, fighting off the resistance of its archenemies, to a ‘game.’ Along with a subtle warning that tells you not to fall into the traps that may cause dizziness, it sends a message to keep moving forward, even enjoying the tension and stress that may come from the game. ‘DICE’ is a track that can be defined as ‘MIXX POP’, a crossover between hip-hop, jazz, pop and trap. The c<span class="moreellipses">...&nbsp;</span><span class="morecontent"><span>ombination of sophisticated yet colorful jazz sounds, dreamy trap, pop, addictive beats, and the catchy chorus, which is based on a bluesy &amp; rhythmical brass sound, makes this track a huge pleasure to the ear.<br><br>2. COOL (Your rainbow)<br><br>The track ‘COOL (Your Rainbow)’ is a song that talks about the fact that the negative emotions that we often consider ‘not cool’ or ‘toxic’ is also a precious part of our mind. It compares the process of us recognizing and gathering all of the emotions that we feel in our daily lives to the changes in the weather. This song is about the journey of NMIXX, who will explore through their emotions, emitting their newfound light as they find their new rainbow while walking through their days of fogs and darkness. ‘COOL (Your Rainbow)’ is a pop ballad track that combines the 808 bass &amp; trap beat along with a variety of sounds of dreamy brass and classical strings. The unique tone and special talent of NMIXX will be highlighted through this track.<br><br>
